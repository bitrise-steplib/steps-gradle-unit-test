title: Run Gradle Tests
summary: |-
  Runs tests with `gradlew`.
description: |-
  This Step runs tests with `gradlew`.
  You can specify the test tasks to run and set flags to the executed `gradlew` command.

  ### Configuring the Step

  To use this Step, you need at least two things:
  * [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).
  * A Gradle task that is correctly configured in your Gradle project.

  To configure the Step:
  1. Set the Gradle project root directory in the **Project root directory** input.
  1. Add the task you want to run in the **Test task** input.
  1. (Optional) Add any flags you want to pass to the executed gradlew command in the **Additional flags** input. For example, you can use `--tests='*.MyTestClass'` to run a specific test class.
  1. (Optional) You can set the file path to a `build.gradle` file for the Step in the **Path to the Gradle build script to use** input.

  ### Troubleshooting

  If you receive an error that Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, make sure to generate one if you don't have one already. You can read
  more about it in the [official Gradle guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).
